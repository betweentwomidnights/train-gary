for make dataset with audiocraft

uses demucs, then splits/resamples, then uses essentia autolabelling to extract features, creates and places jsons/yaml in the correct place for the dora run command to get rocking.

idea:

can be used in combination with voting mechanisms to decide what gets added to /dataset/gary idk...

can also just be used by anyone to get whatever music they put in /dataset/gary.

kev still doesn't quite understand the bittensor and blockchain side of this project, so he's just building.
